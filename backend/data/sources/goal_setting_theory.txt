Goal Setting Theory, introduced by Edwin Locke, states that specific and challenging goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy ones. Goals direct attention, mobilize effort, increase persistence, and encourage the development of strategies.

The five principles of effective goal setting are: clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback, and task complexity. Clear goals eliminate ambiguity, while challenging ones inspire focus. Commitment comes from connecting goals to personal values or identity. Feedback helps you adjust and stay aligned, and breaking down complex goals prevents burnout.

When setting goals, use the SMART framework â€” Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Combine it with emotional awareness: ask yourself *why* this goal matters and how it connects to your larger sense of purpose. This transforms goal pursuit from mechanical execution to meaningful progress.
