Life design combines intentional living with creative problem-solving. Instead of drifting through circumstances, you architect your lifestyle to align with your passions, goals, and well-being.

Principles of life design:
1. Curiosity — approach life as an experiment, not a script.
2. Reframing — turn problems into opportunities.
3. Prototyping — test small changes before committing.
4. Radical collaboration — seek insights from mentors and peers.
5. Mindful iteration — reflect, refine, and repeat.

By viewing your life as a design project, you shift from reacting to creating. Neuraline’s purpose and cognition agents support this approach by connecting self-reflection with structured planning.

Design your days with intention, and your life will align naturally.
