A habit loop is the neurological pattern that governs every habit. It consists of three key components: the cue, the routine, and the reward.

The cue acts as a trigger, signaling your brain to initiate a certain behavior. The routine is the actual action or sequence you perform in response to that cue. The reward is the positive outcome that reinforces the behavior, convincing your brain that this loop is worth repeating.

To build sustainable habits, identify and modify the cue and reward rather than focusing only on the routine. For example, if you want to develop a study habit, pair studying with a rewarding experience, like listening to calming music or a favorite beverage.

Awareness is the foundation of change. Map out your daily loops â€” what triggers them, what actions follow, and how they make you feel. Over time, you can rewire loops to align with your goals and values. Small, consistent changes compound into powerful transformations.
