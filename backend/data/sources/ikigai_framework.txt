Ikigai is a Japanese philosophy that means “reason for being.” It lies at the intersection of four questions:  
- What do you love?  
- What are you good at?  
- What does the world need?  
- What can you be paid for?

Discovering your ikigai is a lifelong process of reflection and experimentation. It encourages balance — between self-fulfillment and contribution, passion and practicality.

To find your ikigai, list answers to each question and look for overlaps. Notice where enthusiasm meets usefulness. Neuraline’s purpose agent can guide users to identify their evolving ikigai and integrate it into their life design.

Ikigai reminds us that meaning is not found — it’s cultivated daily through mindful choices.
