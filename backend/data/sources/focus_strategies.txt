Focus is the ability to direct attention deliberately and resist distraction. In the modern world, attention is constantly hijacked by digital stimuli, making deep work rare and valuable.

Strategies to improve focus include:
- The Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of deep work, 5 minutes rest.
- Environmental design: eliminate visual and digital clutter.
- Single-tasking: one tab, one goal.
- Intentional breaks: stepping away restores clarity.
- Reflection: review what distracted you and why.

True focus comes from emotional alignment. When tasks align with your values, resistance decreases. Neuraline uses reflective feedback to understand what drives or drains focus, turning attention management into a personalized discipline.
